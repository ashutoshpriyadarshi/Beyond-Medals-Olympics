# Olympics Data Analysis (1896 - 2016)
Welcome to the Olympics Data Analysis project! The Olympics Data Analysis Project aims to delve into the rich history of the Olympic Games, this repository contains a comprehensive analysis of the Olympics data spanning from the first modern Olympics in 1896 to the 2016 Games. This project leverages Python to explore and visualize trends, performance, and historical insights from over a century of Olympic history over the time.

# Features
* **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:** Scripts for cleaning and preparing raw Olympics data for analysis.
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Jupyter notebooks with detailed EDA to uncover interesting trends and patterns in the data.
* **Visualizations:** A variety of charts and graphs to visualize athletes' performance, medal distributions, country-wise participation, and more.
* **Medal Distribution:** Examine how medals have been distributed across different countries and sports over the years.
* **Historical Insights:** Discover how the Games have evolved, including changes in events, athlete participation, and country representation.
* **Performance Analysis:** Analyze the performance trends of athletes and countries, identifying factors that contribute to success.
* **Gender Analysis:** Explore the participation and performance trends of male and female athletes.
* **Interactive Dashboards:** Interactive visualizations for user-friendly data exploration.

% Instructions to Set Up the Python Project with a Virtual Environment

% 1. Create the virtual environment:
% Run the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
% python -m venv minor7thsem

% 2. Activate the virtual environment:
% Windows:
% .\minor7thsem\Scripts\activate
%
% If you encounter issues creating or activating the virtual environment, 
% follow these steps to resolve them:

% Step 1: Open PowerShell as an Administrator
% Right-click on the Start menu and select "Windows PowerShell (Admin)".

% Step 2: Change the Execution Policy
% To allow scripts to run if they are signed by a trusted publisher:
% Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
%
% For a more permissive policy, you can use:
% Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass

% Step 3: Verify the Execution Policy
% Check the current execution policy with:
% Get-ExecutionPolicy

% After changing the execution policy, try running the activation command again.

% 3. Install the required dependencies:
% Use the following command to install all necessary packages:
% pip install -r requirements.txt
